# NezDemo
This a starting point for any Nez based project. Heavily based off [Nez-Samples](https://github.com/prime31/Nez-Samples).

# Getting started
- copy this repo to your machine. Rename any instance of `NezGame` with your project title.
TODO: make this a script to autogenerate a new project
- Rename `NezDemo` to whatever you need


# Quirks for Mac
- Mono is complex to set up for Mac
- according to the docs of Nez, it is best to copy Nez directly to your project instead of relying on Nuget (their release cycle on Nuget is very inconsistent).
